                The Estates General was the general assembly of France. It was
                divided into three estates: the clergy (First Estate), the
                nobility (Second Estate) and the rest of the population (Third
                Estate). The Estates General had last met in 1614 but it was
                summoned by King Louis XVI in May 1789 as the nation was facing
                a severe financial crisis. Each estate had only one vote. Thus,
                though the Third Estate comprised of more than 98% of the French
                population, it was usually overruled by the nobility and the
                clergy. In the lead up to the meeting of the Estates General on
                May 5, the Third Estate gathered support for equal
                representation but the negotiation with the other two estates
                failed. In response, the Third Estate decided to form their own
                National Assembly. On June 20, 1789, Louis XVI ordered the
                closure of the Salle des États where the Assembly met. The Third
                Estate moved to an indoor tennis court where they pledged not to
                separate until they had given France a constitution. This became
                known as the Tennis Court Oath.

                As the National Constituent Assembly continued to meet at
                Versailles, soldiers, mostly foreign mercenaries, began to
                arrive in Paris. Also, Jacques Necker, director-general of the
                finances who was considered sympathetic to the common people,
                was dismissed by King Louis XVI. The Parisians interpreted these
                actions as an attempt toward shutting down the National
                Constituent Assembly. They responded by storming toward the
                Bastille fortress on July 14, 1789, to secure gunpowder and
                weapons. The troops at Bastille resisted for a few hours before
                they surrendered to the mob. The fall of the Bastille, a symbol
                of power and the monarchy’s dictatorial rule, is considered by
                some as the start of the French Revolution. It resulted in King
                Louis XVI withdrawing the royal troops from the French capital
                and recalling finance minister Jacques Necker. Due to the
                significance of the Storming of the Bastille, July 14 is
                celebrated as the national day of France. It is known as
                Bastille Day in English.

                On 4 and 11 August, 1789, the Constituent Assembly abolished the
                entire feudal system. It abolished both Manorialism of the
                Second Estate and the tithes gathered by the First Estate.
                Manorialism was an integral part of feudalism by which peasants
                were rendered dependent on their land and on their lord. Tithes
                was one tenth of annual produce or earnings taken as a tax for
                the support of the church. Thus the peasants got their land free
                and also no longer paid the tithe to the church. Other proposals
                followed with the same success: the equality of legal
                punishment, admission of all to public office, abolition of
                venality in office and freedom of worship. Thus during the
                course of a few hours, nobles, clergy, towns, provinces,
                companies and cities lost their special privileges.

                Bad harvests in France had caused the price of flour to increase
                dramatically, which in turn raised the price of bread, the
                staple food of most French citizens. Many people in Paris were
                thus hungry and restless. On 5th October 1789, a large crowd of
                protesters, mostly women, began to assemble at Parisian markets.
                After getting unsatisfactory responses from city officials, the
                women marched from Paris to the Palace of Versailles. They were
                convinced that the royal family lived in luxury oblivious to the
                problems of the common people. They stormed the palace, killing
                several guards and demanded the king to “live among the people”.
                Louis XVI ultimately conceded to their demands and agreed to go
                to Paris with the mob. The royal family in Paris was placed
                under the “protection” of the National Guards, thus legitimizing
                the National Assembly.

                On 26th August 1789, the Assembly published the Declaration of
                the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, a charter of human
                liberties, containing the principles that inspired the French
                Revolution. The basic principle of the Declaration was that all
                “men are born and remain free and equal in rights”. Its 17
                articles served as the preamble to the Constitution. The long
                awaited constitution finally came into effect on September 30,
                1791. France was proclaimed a constitutional monarchy, while the
                National Assembly was dissolved and replaced by a new political
                body named the Legislative Assembly. King Louis XVI became a
                little more than a figurehead. He was forced to swear an oath to
                the constitution and a decree that declared that retracting the
                oath, heading an army for the purpose of making war upon the
                nation or permitting anyone to do so in his name would amount to
                abdication.
